# Module 2

* Flutter app is composed with components ( those are widgets ).
* Widget is immutable description of an UI component on a screen.
  * Widgets are immutable so when we want to update the widget we have to rerender it with new data.
* Widget Tree
  * Parent-Child relationship
  * When pointing widgets,Flutter SDK uses BuildContext(component) for navigation.
  * Flutter SDK renders Widget Tree Top-to-Bottom.

* Widget Types
    1. Stateless Widget
    2. Stateful Widget
